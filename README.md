No offense to my Meta brothers and sisters out there!

-  📝 through out my 7+ self-taught years, I have learned to fall in love with knowledge, the History of A.I. and Technology in General.

- I graduated with Academic Achievement Awards in Social Studies and Mathematics. Eventually, I attended college for one year before dropping out to find my calling. After many trials and errors, and through sheer tenacity and perseverance, I remembered what my college counselor once said when assessing my skills and interests. He said, "You should pursue a career in Computer Science. Computers are the future, and you can never regret a good education."
